I am a highly skilled front-end developer 
with over 6 years of experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I have worked on several projects over the years, starting with building static HTML pages and styling them with CSS. 
I then learned how to use JavaScript to create dynamic components and later became proficient in using Jquery.

In my first year as a front-end developer, I worked as a freelancer and honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
In 2017, I landed my first full-time role where I used Jquery and AngularJS as my front-end library and framework of choice.

Later on, I also worked with Ionic to build cross-platform mobile apps. 
During this time, I was part of a team that upgraded from using AngularJS to Angular+2 and I have since used Angular 9 in a previous role.

In 2019, I joined a new team tasked with developing a new product. I was part of the architecture team that chose VueJS version 2 as our front-end stack after researching the various options available. I worked with VueJS for a year and a half, during which time I also led training sessions to help my team upgrade to VueJS version 3.

After building a strong reputation in the local market, I was offered a freelance consulting contract with a startup. In this role, I helped the startup establish a development process and trained the team on the best practices for delivery. I also set up a Github strategy for the team to streamline their development and delivery process.

More recently, I worked with a startup as a consultant for 6 months and then moved to my current employer. I have worked with a new business model, helping offshore companies source developers for various projects.

I have led a front-end team for a project owned by my current employer and a strategic partner building a governmental portal for the KSA government. I was responsible for creating the project structure and training new team members with varying front-end framework backgrounds. We successfully delivered the first release and the project was adopted by the KSA government.

I have also worked with the KSA Ministry of Justice as a critical partner, helping the team upgrade some of their projects and build reusable components using Vue3 and ReactJS. In this role, I gained experience in microfront-end architecture and Agile development with large, multi-disciplinary teams.

Presently, I lead a front-end team for a client in Ireland, UK.
